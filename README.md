Aloe
----

A [Gherkin][gherkin] runner for Python based on [Nose][nose] and
[Lettuce][lettuce].

Install:

    pip install aloe

Read the [documentation][docs].

Invocation
==========

`aloe` command line tool is a wrapper for the `nose` runner, configured to only
run Gherkin tests. As such, the invocation is the same as `nose`, but the
following parameters are added:

* `-n N[,N...]` - only run the specified scenarios (by number, 1-based) in each
  feature. Makes sense when only specifying one feature to run, for example

  `aloe features/calculator.feature -n 1`

* `--test-class` - override the class used as a base for each feature.

* `--no-ignore-python` - run Python tests as well as Gherkin.

Migrating from Lettuce
======================

Aloe, started as a fork of Lettuce, tries to be compatible where it makes
sense. However, there are following incompatible changes:

* `each_scenario` and `each_background` callbacks are removed. Use
  `each_example`.
* `-s` option for running particular scenarios is renamed to `-n`.
* Django-related functionality, including the `harvest` command, is moved to a
  separate project, [Aloe-Django][aloe-django].
* `terrain.py` has no particular significance. It will be imported but only if
  it exists at the same directory with the other step definition files, and not
  above it.

TODO
====

In no particular order:

* Verbose output (all steps printed as they run) is missing.
