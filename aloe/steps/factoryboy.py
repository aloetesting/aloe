Aloe integration with `factory_boy`_ to create objects from factories.

Remember when writing BDD tests to describe the behavior you want and not just
use Aloe as a syntax for writing complex tests (that defeats the point of BDD).
Hide the complexity of setting up the objects in your factory or write a
custom step.

To activate these steps import :mod:`aloe.steps.factoryboy` into your
``steps/__init__.py``.

    Decorator to register a :class:`factory.Factory` as an Aloe step:

        Given/And I have (a/an/`n`) `object(s)`

    An optional table can be passed containing attributes that would be
    passed as `kwargs` to :meth:`factory.Factory.create`.
    Multiple rows or a number of objects can be passed to create more than one
    object. If a number of objects is requested, at most one row can be given,
    passed as `kwargs` to :meth:`factory.Factory.create_batch`.

    The name of the object and its plural can be specified as:

    - :code:`_verbose_name` and :code:`_verbose_name_plural` attributes on the
      factory;
    - If the factory creates a Django model, and its name corresponds to the
      model class name (e.g. :code:`UserFactory` and :code:`User`),
      :code:`verbose_name` and :code:`verbose_name_plural` of the model;

    If neither is specified, the object name is inferred from the factory class
    name.
